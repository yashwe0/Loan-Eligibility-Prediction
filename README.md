# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

In today's financial landscape, lending institutions face the crucial task of assessing loan eligibility accurately. The ability to predict whether an individual is likely to repay a loan is paramount for mitigating risks and maintaining a healthy loan portfolio. Traditional methods of risk assessment often fall short in handling the complexities of modern data and evolving borrower behaviors. In response, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as powerful tools for enhancing loan eligibility prediction.

In this guide, we will delve into the world of machine learning and explore how it can be applied to predict loan eligibility effectively. By leveraging Python, a versatile programming language, and popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we will build predictive models capable of making informed decisions based on various borrower attributes.
